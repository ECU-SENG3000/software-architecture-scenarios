Here’s a list and definition of **core software quality attributes** commonly used in software architecture and system design:

---

### **1. Availability**
- **Definition**: The degree to which a system is operational and accessible when required for use.
- **Focus**: Minimizing downtime.
- **Example**: A cloud service with 99.99% uptime ensures high availability.

---

### **2. Modifiability**
- **Definition**: The ease with which a system can be changed to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment.
- **Focus**: Maintainability and adaptability.
- **Example**: A modular codebase allows developers to update features without affecting other parts.

---

### **3. Performance**
- **Definition**: How quickly and efficiently a system responds to user actions or processes data.
- **Focus**: Response time, throughput, and resource usage.
- **Example**: A real-time trading platform must process transactions in milliseconds.

---

### **4. Security**
- **Definition**: The ability of a system to protect data and resist unauthorized access or attacks.
- **Focus**: Confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
- **Example**: A banking app uses encryption and multi-factor authentication to secure user data.

---

### **5. Usability**
- **Definition**: The ease with which users can learn, operate, and interact with a system.
- **Focus**: User experience and interface design.
- **Example**: A mobile app with intuitive navigation and clear instructions enhances usability.

---

### **6. Scalability**
- **Definition**: The ability of a system to handle increased load without performance degradation.
- **Focus**: Growth in users, data, or transactions.
- **Example**: A web application that can scale horizontally by adding more servers.

---

### **7. Resilience**
- **Definition**: The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue operating.
- **Focus**: Fault tolerance and recovery.
- **Example**: A distributed system that reroutes traffic when a node fails.
